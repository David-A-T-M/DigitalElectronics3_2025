# Digital Electronics 3 (2025)

This repository provides educational examples and projects for the Digital Electronics 3 course. The main goal is to offer code samples at different abstraction levels, supporting both the LPC1769 and STM32 microcontroller families.

## Repository Structure

- Each project is organized in a separate folder.
- Inside each project folder, you will find 4 or 5 files:
  - **LPC1769 (register-level):** Direct register manipulation.
  - **LPC1769 (CMSIS drivers):** Using CMSIS drivers for peripheral control.
  - **STM32 (register-level):** Direct register manipulation.
  - **STM32 (LL):** Using STM32 Low-Layer (LL) drivers (if available).
  - **STM32 (HAL):** Using STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) drivers.

## Purpose

The repository is mainly educational, designed to help students and instructors explore and compare different programming approaches and abstraction levels for microcontroller-based projects.

## Migration

There is an ongoing effort to gradually migrate from LPC1769-based examples to STM32-based implementations.

## Usage

Browse each project folder to find code samples for both microcontroller families and at various abstraction levels. These examples are intended for use in Digital Electronics 3 workshops and as a reference for further development.
